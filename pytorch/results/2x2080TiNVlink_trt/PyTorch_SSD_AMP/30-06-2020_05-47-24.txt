Selected optimization level O2:  FP16 training with FP32 batchnorm and FP32 master weights.

Defaults for this optimization level are:
enabled                : True
opt_level              : O2
cast_model_type        : torch.float16
patch_torch_functions  : False
keep_batchnorm_fp32    : True
master_weights         : True
loss_scale             : dynamic
Processing user overrides (additional kwargs that are not None)...
After processing overrides, optimization options are:
